# S.H.I.E.L.D. Guardian IoT Project

**S.H.I.E.L.D. Guardian** is an IoT-based security system designed to monitor and secure physical environments. The system integrates an ESP32 microcontroller for hardware control and a Python-based GUI for user interaction, making it simple to monitor security status and control various IoT functions from a central interface.

## Features

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: 
  - Handles all hardware interactions and security logic.
  - `buzzer_class.py` manages sound alerts for various security events.
  - `caveau.py` manages vault-like secure operations, including locks and access control.

- **Python GUI**: 
  - A user-friendly graphical interface (`S.H.I.E.L.D.Guardian.py`) allows users to monitor and interact with the system.
  - Real-time status updates and control options for security operations.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

### Hardware
- An ESP32 microcontroller
- Buzzer or other connected alarm devices (optional)

### Software
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- PyQt5 for the GUI (for Python)
- A way to flash code onto the ESP32 (e.g., `esptool`)

### Python Dependencies
- PyQt5 (for the GUI application)
- `esptool` (to flash the ESP32)
- Any other dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file (add if needed)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SHIELD-Guardian.git
   cd SHIELD-Guardian
   ```

2. **Setup Python Environment**:
   It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5
   pip install esptool
   ```

4. **Flash the ESP32**:
   Use `esptool` or any other preferred method to flash `buzzer_class.py` and `caveau.py` onto the ESP32.

## Usage

1. **ESP32 Setup**: 
   - Flash the necessary code to your ESP32, including the buzzer and secure operations logic.

2. **Run the GUI**:
   - Start the Python GUI by running:
     ```
     python S.H.I.E.L.D.Guardian.py
     ```
   - Use the GUI to monitor the security system, trigger alarms, and manage the secure vault functions.

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure the ESP32 and your machine running the GUI are connected to the same network (Wi-Fi or other means).

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Sensors**: Adding more sensors (e.g., temperature, motion) to enhance security and automation capabilities.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Allowing remote access and monitoring via the cloud for real-time updates from anywhere.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding the system to support multiple languages for broader accessibility.
